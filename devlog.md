Connect to localhost:1234 LM Studio endpoint

Phase 2: Frontend UI [done]

Design dark theme chat interface with message bubbles
Add input field with send button functionality
Implement auto-scrolling chat view

Phase 3: Integration

Connect QML to C++ backend via signals/slots
Handle async AI responses and display in chat
Add error handling for network issues

Phase 4: Polish

Add animations and responsive design
Test with LM Studio and Llama models
Deploy and document

Tech Stack: Qt6, QML, C++, HTTP API, LM Studio

-ðŸŸ¢ Solved Critical LLM Backend Configuration: I resolved the persistent CUDA error: device kernel image is invalid and related runtime crashes by definitively fixing the llama.cpp CMake build configuration. This involved a complete rebuild after enforcing the correct CUDA Toolkit version (12.6) and setting the GPU architecture strictly to "86" (RTX 3070 Ti) using FORCE flags in CMakeLists.txt before the project() command, which finally eliminated conflicts and allowed the model to successfully offload all layers to VRAM for GPU-accelerated inference.
